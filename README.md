# TSDIT_CHATBOT

## Introduction

Nowadays, Chatbots have become an indispensable tool for customer service and query resolution. These intelligence systems artificial have stood out for their ability to interact naturally and fluid with users, offering complete and precise responses. Likewise, in the educational context, Chatbots can also play a role. important role in improving the student experience. For example, can be used to provide academic assistance, answer questions about the study plan or administrative processes. Therefore, this project proposes the implementation of a Chatbot through the WhatsApp instant messaging service, whose purpose is to solve the concerns that students may have about the existing procedures for the curricular project of Technology in Data Systematization and Engineering in Telematics.

The design and deployment of the Chatbot will be carried out with a distributed approach, scalable and efficient, ensuring its ability to handle an increase gradual increase in users. To achieve this purpose, the technologies are defined necessary and the Kanban methodology that is precise to meet the objectives established.

It is important for the curricular project, within the context of assistance administrative, have a tool that supports the management of procedures that will benefit both students and administrators, for quick resolution and reliable of the concerns that may arise

## STATE OF ART

4.1. REFERENTIAL FRAMEWORK
The existing knowledge in the literature about Chatbots in the sector
Education is very diversified and mostly aims to improve learning
of student. It is evident that the technological mediation between the student and the
university has improved communication through the use of
emerging technologies, student preferences are increasingly
demanding, not only in their training process, but in their way of communicating.

Comm100 announced the results of a new survey on April 11, 2023
conducted to North American higher education students about their
communication preferences during the registration and admission processes. A
Key survey finding revealed that digital communication with schools
is the most important support factor for future students, these
The results emphasize once again the need for
admissions adopt digital channels to meet support expectations
of the students. The survey revealed the overwhelming openness of futures
students to use Chatbots, with 95% of students at least somewhat open
to receive support from a Chatbot [2].

With respect to this study, the potential of Chatbots in a
only process that is admissions, however, extending the scope of
a Chatbot beyond a process in the student is a challenge, but the
literature has revealed some success stories. Authors Trung Thanh
Nguyen and Anh Duc Le designed and implemented a Chatbot in the office
admissions from the National University of Economics in Vietnam which was
integrated into the university's Facebook Fanpage resulting in
availability of responses in real time 24 hours a day with effective
of 90.29% in a sample of 50,000 questions.

To achieve this result, the authors implemented a series of modeling models. deep learning natively integrated into the Rasa Framework [3] which is a powerful set of libraries in the Python programming language specialized in conversational AI. While it is true that the Rasa Framework is a great open source tool your learning curve can be a challenge, in addition to its integration with external systems such as APIs and others services has a certain complexity that is not convenient in an environment of production.

A group of researchers from the Institute of Engineering and Technology made a Complete analysis of the way Chatbots are currently developed extracting the best attributes, qualities, patterns, functional characteristics and quality when building a Chatbots that can achieve high rates of customer satisfaction.

The research is based mainly on surveys and what was found In the literature review, a series of aspects are defined in the research to consider in the design and development of a Chatbot, Initially the article suggests that the developer must have knowledge of markup language AI, Pattern Matching, Chat Script, Parsing, Databases and Strings Markov.

The article also proposes that the main reference point for constructing a Chatbot can be started from the ISO 9126-1 Quality Model which emphasizes six known key features such as functionality, reliability, ease of use, efficiency, ease of maintenance and portability that are based on the capacity to meet anticipated and unforeseen needs [4].

It was also found that there are seven elements that contribute to the design and development of the Chatbot increasingly similar to a human agent these elements correspond to technical functionalities, efficiency, effectiveness, humanistic, ethics, technical satisfaction and accessibility. This research provides as a theoretical and architectural reference in the construction of the assistant intelligent academic.

Simon Prananta Barus and Evalien Surijati implemented a Chatbot in the University of Matana in Indonesia in the face of the challenges brought by the pandemic, this Chatbot basically focused on frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the library in order to guarantee online services 24/7. The development of Chatbot was made in a minimalist way through the Dialogflow platform from Google that makes it easy to design and integrate Chatbot into other applications, This platform runs in the cloud and allows the creation of models of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) which is the basis for developing Chatbot [5].

Likewise, the technical complexity of this implementation was mainly due to in the design of the NLP model of the Chatbot where the design of a conversation where agents, intentions, entities, contexts, events, compliance and integration for the development of a model suitable. Dialogflow beyond a tool is a cloud service classified as a SaaS-type solution, although it is true that it can simplify and make sufficient abstractions in the development must be considered and analyzed its rate and costs of use.

So far the analyzes carried out show some technical and operational aspects. quality that is worth taking into account, but the way to encompass the problem remains a challenge. A research carried out at the Inter-American School of Library Science at the University of Antioquia in Colombia proposes a framework structured methodological based on Design Thinking for the design of virtual assistants (Chatbots). This framework is made up of the following stages: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and evaluate, which in turn include a series of techniques and methodological instruments used with a focus qualitative, exploratory and descriptive scope which favored the recognition of the actors involved in the virtual education processes, these actors were essential to generate a state of empathy in the team research [6]. This research was strongly supported by surveys where it is evident that among the students' preferences are: Web and mobile interoperability (via WhatsApp), using phrases short and simple, without technicalities, Hybrid (with default options, but with the possibility of asking) Textual communication based on FAQ (questions frequent).

Conversational artificial intelligence has had an incremental boom since At the end of 2022, after the arrival of chatGTP, it was evident that this application I reached 100 million monthly active users in just 2 months something that it took Instagram two and a half years, setting a record like the fastest growing application in history [7].

The core of an application of this magnitude works through a model of large language (LLM) which is a type of model based on neural networks which is trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human language, chatGTP 3.5 LLM has 175 billion parameters spread over 96 layers in the neural network which makes it one of the largest deep learning models ever created [8].

ChatGTP is currently the greatest exponent of Chatbot technologies to study Its architecture and integration modes are novel and can provide knowledge cutting-edge research.
